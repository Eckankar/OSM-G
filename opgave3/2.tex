\section{Conditional variables}

The implementation of conditional variables is pretty simple.

A conditional variable is simply a \mono{void *}, as we had no data that
needed to be stored inside of it.

When waiting on a conditional variable, the thread is simply put on the
sleep queue, and the given lock is released, to be relocked whenever it is
reawakened.

For signal and broadcast, we simply perform a \mono{sleepq\_wake} and
\mono{sleepq\_wake\_all}, respectively. As for why we're getting a lock, we're
unsure.

For resetting, we simply wake anything that may be sleeping on the conditional,
just to make sure that everything will work the way we intend it.
