\section{New syscalls}
The system calls 
\texttt{syscall\_lock\_create}, 
\texttt{syscall\_lock\_acquire}, 
\texttt{syscall\_lock\_release}, \\
\texttt{syscall\_condition\_create}, 
\texttt{syscall\_condition\_wait}, 
\texttt{syscall\_condition\_signal} \& \\ 
\texttt{syscall\_condition\_broadcast} all correspond to an existing function 
amongst the \texttt{lock\_*} and \texttt{condition\_*} functions. As such, they 
are merely wrapper-functions for their obvious counterparts, that aren't prefixed 
by \texttt{syscall\_}.
