\section{New syscalls}
The system calls \mono{syscall\_lock\_create},\mono{syscall\_lock\_acquire},
\mono{syscall\_lock\_release}, \mono{syscall\_condition\_create},
\mono{syscall\_condition\_wait}, \mono{syscall\_condition\_signal} \&
\mono{syscall\_condition\_broadcast} all correspond to an existing function
amongst the \mono{lock\_*} and \mono{condition\_*} functions. As such, they
are merely wrapper-functions for their obvious counterparts, that aren't prefixed
by \mono{syscall\_}.
