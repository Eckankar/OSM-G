\section{Custom functions}

In order to better facilitate testing, a number of additional helper functions
have been added.

In order to free the memory we've consumed, the following functions have been
added:
\begin{description}
    \item[Problem 1] {
        \mono{delete\_tree} for recursively freeing the memory used by a tree
        and zeroing out the pointer to it.
    }
    \item[Problem 2] {
        \mono{remove\_and\_free}, which removes and frees the first element of
        the list, moving the pointer to the next element.
    }
    \item[Problem 3] {
        \mono{delete\_tree2} for recursively freeing the memory used by a tree
        and zeroing out the pointer to it.

        Note, that this does \emph{not} free the values, only the tree itself.
        If the tree is to be used with dynamically allocated structures, an
        elegant approach would be to pass a function pointer to a function
        for freeing the elements contained within.
    }
\end{description}

In addition, a \mono{print\_inorder2} was added, which prints the elements
contained within a tree, using a custom print function, in order to verify
the correctness of the data contained within.
