\section{dlist\_t}

The implementation of \mono{tree2dlist} is based off of two helping functions:

\subsection{The function insert\_before}
To make working with the circular doubly linked lists easier, we chose to
implement a function, which inserts a node before the current one.

This function takes care of properly allocating memory for the link and
moving the pointers of the existing elements around, such that the list
remains circular.

\subsection{The function tree2dlist\_recursive}
With \mono{insert\_before} in hand, we can perform an in-order tree walk
on the tree, inserting the elements before the first element. Since the list
is circular, this is equivalent to inserting the new element in the last spot.

This elegantly lets us keep the first element as our current element at all
times.
